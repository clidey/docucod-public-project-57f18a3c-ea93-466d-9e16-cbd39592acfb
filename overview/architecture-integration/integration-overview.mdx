# Integrations & Deployment

## Unlock Seamless Site Deployment and Content Integration

Effortlessly connect your Astro-powered portfolio-site with modern deployment ecosystems and content workflows. This page explains how integrations like Netlify and static export come together with your site's core configuration files to enable smooth, maintainable setups that scale with your needs.

### Why This Matters

Imagine deploying updates to your site instantly without juggling multiple configuration files. With well-integrated deployment and content management pipelines, you can focus on what matters most: crafting engaging content and showcasing your work.

### What You Will Learn Here

- How portfolio-site integrates with deployment platforms such as Netlify.
- How static export is handled for optimized hosting.
- How content pipelines work to automate blog URL discovery for sitemaps.
- The role of core configuration files in orchestrating these steps.

---

## Integration & Deployment Overview

At the heart of portfolio-site’s deployment process is the `astro.config.mjs` configuration that serves as the single source of truth. It combines build settings, deployment adapters, and integration plugins to provide a unified and declarative configuration. This design reduces manual effort and accelerates your deployment lifecycle.

### Key Integrations Covered

- **Netlify Adapter:** Tailors your build for deployment on Netlify, leveraging serverless functions and CDN delivery.
- **Static Export:** Enables output of a fully static site suitable for traditional static hosts.
- **Content Pipeline Automation:** Dynamically discovers blog post URLs by scanning your content directory during build.
- **SEO Enhancements:** Automatic sitemap and `robots.txt` generation keep search engines informed and guide crawler behavior.

These components work together seamlessly to turn your source content and code into a live, discoverable personal website with minimal overhead.

---

## How Integrations Work Together

The deployment ecosystem relies on a well-structured config that manages site URL, build directories, adapter selection, and integrations. Here's the flow:

1. **Configuration Declaration:** You declare your site properties, including URL, output folder, and integrations, in `astro.config.mjs`.

2. **Content Discovery:** At build time, the system reads your blog content folder (`src/content/blog`). It automatically extracts filenames and converts them into URL paths representing each blog post.

3. **Plugin Execution:** Plugins for MDX support, sitemap generation, and `robots.txt` creation run during the build, using the discovered blog URLs and configuration to build auxiliary SEO files.

4. **Deployment Packaging:** The Netlify adapter prepares the entire site for deployment on Netlify’s serverless infrastructure, ensuring build outputs are optimized for fast delivery.

5. **Live Website:** After deployment, your site is live at the configured URL, featuring dynamic sitemaps and managed crawler behavior.

## Core Configuration File Explained

Here's an example excerpt from a typical `astro.config.mjs` file used by portfolio-site:

```js
import { fileURLToPath } from 'url';
import path from 'path';
import fs from 'fs';
import { defineConfig } from 'astro/config';
import mdx from '@astrojs/mdx';
import netlify from '@astrojs/netlify';
import sitemap from '@astrojs/sitemap';
import robotsTxt from 'astro-robots-txt';

const __filename = fileURLToPath(import.meta.url);
const __dirname = path.dirname(__filename);
const directoryPath = path.join(__dirname, 'src/content/blog');
const files = fs.readdirSync(directoryPath);
const blogUrls = files.map(file => `/blog/${file.replace(/\.mdx?$/, '')}/`);

export default defineConfig({
  outDir: '../../../../wwwzuang.github.io/_site',
  site: 'https://www.zuang.com/',
  adapter: netlify(),
  integrations: [
    mdx(),
    sitemap({
      filter: (page) => page !== '/index',
      hostname: 'https://www.zuang.com',
      routes: blogUrls,
    }),
    robotsTxt({
      policy: [
        { userAgent: '*', allow: '/' },
        { userAgent: '*', disallow: ['/404'] },
      ],
    }),
  ],
});
```

### Breakdown

- **File System Scanning:** Uses Node.js `fs` and `path` modules to list blog files and construct URL paths dynamically.
- **Site Settings:** Defines output directory and canonical site URL for proper link resolution.
- **Adapter Setup:** Specifies `netlify()` adapter to optimize builds for Netlify.
- **Integrations Array:** Includes MDX plugin for rich content, sitemap generator that includes dynamic URLs, and robots.txt with tailored crawler policies.

## Practical Benefits and User Scenarios

Using portfolio-site’s integration and deployment setup, you enjoy:

- **Automatic Blog Sitemaps:** Every new blog post added to your content folder is automatically included in your sitemap without manual edits.
- **Simplified Hosting:** Just configure your site URL and point your Netlify project to your repository—everything else is handled.
- **Crawl Control:** Easily customize robots.txt rules to protect sensitive paths or prevent indexing of error pages.
- **Support for Modern Content:** Seamless MDX integration lets you enrich your markdown posts with React components.

### Example Use Case

You are a content creator who writes blogs regularly and wants every new post instantly discoverable by search engines. Dropping a new MDX file in `src/content/blog` will be picked up and included in the sitemap automatically at the next build, saving you from manual configuration or error-prone edits.

---

## Getting Started with Integrations & Deployment

To enable this smooth deployment experience:

- **Edit your `astro.config.mjs`:** Define your site URL, output folder, and adopt the Netlify adapter along with MDX, sitemap, and robots.txt plugins.
- **Organize blog content:** Store blog posts under `src/content/blog` in markdown or MDX format.
- **Build your site:** Run `npm run build` to generate up-to-date static assets, including SEO files.
- **Deploy on Netlify:** Connect your repository or upload the build output folder to Netlify for instant publishing.

For detailed deployment steps, see the [Deployment Guide](../configuration/deployment/deployment-guide).

## Best Practices for Integration and Deployment

- **Keep your configuration modular and declarative**, making adjustments easy as your site grows.
- **Use consistent naming conventions** in your content directories to ensure automatic URL generation works flawlessly.
- **Test sitemap and robots.txt regularly** after adding new content to verify SEO settings.
- **Avoid exposing sensitive paths** by properly configuring your robots.txt `disallow` rules.
- **Leverage Netlify’s continuous deployment** by connecting your Git repository to trigger builds automatically on every commit.

<Note>
Ensure that paths used in dynamic URL discovery and adapters match your actual project structure to prevent build failures.
