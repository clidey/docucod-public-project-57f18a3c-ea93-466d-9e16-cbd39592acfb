# Customize Site Styles and Branding

Practical instructions to change the site’s visual identity by updating colors, typography, and layout. This guide helps you personalize your Astro-based portfolio website’s appearance to align with your unique brand or personal preferences, leveraging the main CSS file and component styling overrides.

---

## 1. Why Customize Your Site Styles?

- **Express Your Brand**: Make your site visually unique and reflective of your personal or professional style.
- **Improve Readability & User Experience**: Tailor fonts and colors for clarity and ease of navigation.
- **Ensure Consistency Across Pages**: Centralize style changes that apply globally for a polished look.
- **Support Light & Dark Modes**: Manage theme colors for better accessibility and user comfort.


## 2. Understanding the Styling Structure

The portfolio site uses a combination of global CSS variables, scoped component styles, and theme-aware rules:

- **Global CSS Variables:** Defined in `src/styles/main.css`, these variables control primary colors, font families, spacing, and highlights.
- **Component Scoped Styles:** Local styles in components or pages can add or override base styles.
- **Theme Support:** Media queries adapt colors and backgrounds for light and dark modes automatically.

The styles are loaded globally by the `<BaseHead />` component on every page, ensuring uniform application.


## 3. Before You Begin

### Prerequisites

- Access to the project source files, especially the `src/styles/main.css` file.
- Basic familiarity with CSS and how selectors apply styles.
- Development environment to test style changes locally.

### Recommended Tools

- Code editor with CSS syntax highlighting (e.g., VS Code).
- Local development server running the portfolio site for live-preview.


## 4. Step-by-Step Customization Workflow

<Steps>
<Step title="Locate and Open the Main CSS File">
The key styles and variables are in `src/styles/main.css`. This file includes the CSS custom properties defining core colors, fonts, and base layout styles. Open this file in your code editor to start customization.
</Step>
<Step title="Modify Global CSS Variables for Colors and Fonts">
Inside `:root`, you will find variables such as `--metal-blue`, `--dark-blue`, `--highlight-color`, and font family declarations. Change these values to update the site's color scheme or typography.

```css
:root {
  --metal-blue: #124559;
  --dark-blue: #0a2e44;
  --highlight-color: #ff6f61;
  --font-primary: 'Open Sans', sans-serif;
  /* ...other variables... */
}
```

Adjust color hex codes or font families to your preferences.
</Step>
<Step title="Customize Layout and Typography">
You can add or override CSS rules in the same stylesheet or create new style blocks to:

- Change heading sizes and weights.
- Adjust paragraph line heights and spacing.
- Modify container widths or padding for layout tweaks.

Example to make headings larger:

```css
h1, h2, h3 {
  font-weight: 700;
  margin-bottom: 1rem;
}
h1 {
  font-size: 2.5rem;
}
```
</Step>
<Step title="Override Component-Specific Styles">
If you need fine control over specific UI components (like headers, buttons, or footers), locate their component CSS or define new styles targeting their classes or IDs.

For example, to change the header background color:

```css
.header {
  background-color: var(--dark-blue);
}
```

Make sure to inspect component markup to use accurate selectors.
</Step>
<Step title="Test Dark Mode Compatibility">
The site supports light and dark themes through media queries. Test your color changes in both modes to ensure accessibility:

```css
@media (prefers-color-scheme: dark) {
  :root {
    --background-color: #121212;
    --text-color: #e0e0e0;
    /* ...other dark mode adjustments... */
  }
}
```

Adjust or add variables here to refine dark mode styling.
</Step>
<Step title="Preview Your Changes Locally">
Run your local development server and view your site in a browser. Verify that colors, typography, and layout changes apply correctly and the site remains responsive.

Use browser devtools to inspect elements and tweak CSS live if needed.
</Step>
<Step title="Commit and Deploy">
Once satisfied with your styles, commit your changes to version control and follow your deployment workflow (e.g., using Netlify).
</Step>
</Steps>


## 5. Practical Examples

### Example 1: Changing Primary Brand Color

In `src/styles/main.css`, update the primary blue tone:

```css
:root {
  --metal-blue: #1a73e8; /* New brand blue */
}
```

This change will ripple through buttons, links, and highlights using this variable.

---

### Example 2: Custom Font Integration

To use a custom Google Font:

1. Add the font import at the top of `main.css`:

```css
@import url('https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Montserrat&display=swap');
```

2. Update the font variable:

```css
:root {
  --font-primary: 'Montserrat', sans-serif;
}
```

3. Confirm all text uses `var(--font-primary)` in the relevant CSS selectors.

---

### Example 3: Adjusting Heading Sizes for Readability

Add the following to your CSS:

```css
h1 {
  font-size: 3rem;
  font-weight: bold;
}
h2 {
  font-size: 2.25rem;
}
```


## 6. Best Practices

- **Use CSS Variables:** Always update the CSS variables instead of hard-coded colors to maintain consistency.
- **Test Responsiveness:** Check your style changes on different screen sizes.
- **Respect Accessibility:** Ensure sufficient contrast between background and text, especially for links and buttons.
- **Version Control:** Backup original styles before making major changes.


## 7. Common Pitfalls & Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup title="Troubleshooting Styling Issues">
<Accordion title="Changes Not Reflecting in Browser">

- Clear your browser cache or use hard refresh (Ctrl+Shift+R).
- Confirm the CSS file is properly imported via the `<BaseHead />` component.
- Check for CSS specificity conflicts overriding your rules.

</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Dark Mode Colors Not Applying">

- Verify `prefers-color-scheme` media query correctness.
- Ensure you define variables inside the dark mode block.
- Test on browsers that support dark mode CSS media queries.

</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Font Not Loading or Displaying Correctly">

- Confirm you imported the font URL correctly.
- Make sure font-family names match exactly.
- Check network requests in browser devtools for errors.

</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

<Tip>
Use browser devtools' CSS inspector to experiment live with style changes before applying them permanently.
</Tip>


## 8. Extending Styles with Component Overrides

If you want to deeply customize components like navigation or footers:

- Look into their source files (e.g., `src/components/Header.astro`).
- Add scoped styles inside those Astro components or create accompanying `.css` files.
- Use class names exposed in the markup for targeted styling.

Example: Change header background color by editing or augmenting styles in your header component.
