# Deploy Your Portfolio Site

Learn how to launch your Astro-powered portfolio site to a live environment. This practical guide walks you through configuring deployment settings, building your site, deploying to popular platforms like Netlify, and verifying that your website is publicly accessible and SEO-optimized.

---

## 1. Overview

### Task Description
This guide helps you deploy your personal website built with the portfolio-site project. It focuses on configuring production-ready settings, building your site artifacts, and publishing to a hosting platform.

### Prerequisites
- You have completed local setup and configuration of the portfolio-site.
- Your site is functional locally with content and configuration finalized.
- Git repository for your project is ready and connected to your hosting platform (e.g., Netlify).
- You have access to deployment platform (Netlify account or equivalent).

### Expected Outcome
By following this guide, you will have a live, publicly accessible website served by an optimized hosting provider with automatically updated SEO essentials such as sitemap.xml and robots.txt.

### Time Estimate
15–30 minutes depending on setup and deployment familiarity.

### Difficulty Level
Beginner to Intermediate (requires basic command line and Git knowledge).

## 2. Step-by-Step Instructions

### Step 1: Configure Your Site URL and Production Settings

Your `astro.config.mjs` controls key deployment settings including your site’s public URL, build output directory, and integration plugins.

- Open `astro.config.mjs`.
- Ensure the `site` value is set to your live domain, for example:

```js
import { defineConfig } from 'astro/config';
import netlify from '@astrojs/netlify';
import mdx from '@astrojs/mdx';
import sitemap from '@astrojs/sitemap';
import robotsTxt from 'astro-robots-txt';

export default defineConfig({
  site: 'https://yourdomain.com',
  output: 'server',
  adapter: netlify(),
  integrations: [
    mdx(),
    sitemap({
      hostname: 'https://yourdomain.com',
      // additional options if needed
    }),
    robotsTxt({
      userAgent: '*',
      allow: '/',
      disallow: '/admin',
      crawlDelay: 10,
    }),
  ],
});
```

This configuration means:
- Your site URL is the production domain.
- Site builds with Netlify adapter for deployment to Netlify.
- MDX support enabled for markdown content.
- Sitemap and robots.txt are generated dynamically.

<Tip>
Replacing `yourdomain.com` with your actual live domain ensures URLs in sitemap and metadata are correct, improving SEO and link functionality.
</Tip>

---

### Step 2: Build Your Site for Production

From your project root, run the build command to generate optimized production-ready files:

```bash
npm run build
```

or if you use yarn:

```bash
yarn build
```

Expected results:
- A `dist/` folder is created containing static assets and server files.
- The sitemap.xml and robots.txt are generated inside `dist/`.
- No build errors are reported.

<Tip>
If the build fails, verify your configuration and content files. See the [Troubleshooting Common Setup Issues](/getting-started/first-run-validation/common-setup-troubleshooting) guide.
</Tip>

### Step 3: Deploy to Netlify

There are two common ways to deploy:

- **Automatic deployment via Git integration:** Connect your GitHub repository to Netlify. Netlify will build and deploy automatically on push.
- **Manual deployment:** Drag and drop the `dist/` folder content into Netlify’s web UI or use Netlify CLI.

#### Automatic Deployment Setup
1. Log in to your [Netlify dashboard](https://app.netlify.com).
2. Click 'New site from Git' and connect your repository.
3. Confirm build command `npm run build` and publish directory `dist`.
4. Deploy the site and wait for build and deploy steps to complete.

#### Manual Deployment Setup
1. Log in to Netlify and create a new site.
2. Upload the contents of your `dist/` folder.
3. Wait for the upload to finish.

<Tip>
Netlify automatically handles CDN distribution and HTTPS provisioning.
</Tip>

### Step 4: Verify Your Deployment

After deployment:

- Visit your live site domain to confirm it loads correctly.
- Check critical pages such as `/about`, `/projects`, `/blog` are rendered with up-to-date content.
- Visit `/sitemap.xml` to confirm your sitemap is generated and includes your pages and blog posts.
- Visit `/robots.txt` to verify crawler directives match your configuration.

<Tip>
Use browser dev tools or online SEO tools to test page HTTP status, SEO metadata, and sitemap validity.
</Tip>

<Tip>
If you see outdated content, try clearing CDN cache or confirm a successful new deployment.
</Tip>

## 3. Practical Example: Deploying on Netlify

1. Update `astro.config.mjs` with your site domain.
2. Run `npm run build`.
3. Push changes to GitHub.
4. Netlify automatically builds and deploys.
5. Open your site URL, verify `/sitemap.xml` and `/robots.txt`.

This common workflow simplifies content updates and deployment synchronization.

## 4. Troubleshooting & Tips

### Common Issues
- **Build fails with errors:** Check for missing or malformed blog post frontmatter.
- **Deployment succeeds but site shows outdated content:** Clear CDN cache or redeploy.
- **Sitemap missing blog post URLs:** Ensure blog posts are in the correct directory (`src/content/blog`) and named properly.
- **robots.txt not blocking disallowed paths:** Verify config options and netlify.toml settings if used.

### Best Practices
- Keep your site URL consistent between `astro.config.mjs` and your deployment platform.
- Regularly test your sitemap and robots.txt URLs after deployment.
- Use MDX for blog posts to add interactivity as needed.

### Performance Considerations
- Netlify’s CDN automatically optimizes content delivery.
- Minimize large images or assets to keep build output lean.
- Use lazy loading in blog posts for media to speed initial page loads.

### Alternative Hosting
This guide focuses on Netlify usage. For other platforms like Vercel or GitHub Pages, adjust build and deployment steps accordingly and update your `astro.config.mjs` adapter or output modes.
