# Quick Validation Checklist

This checklist helps you confirm that your portfolio-site installation is running correctly and that core features are functional before moving on to customization or deployment. Following these steps ensures your base site operates as expected and provides a solid foundation for your personal website.

## 1. Start Your Local Development Server

If you have followed the installation instructions, launch your site locally:

```bash
pnpm run dev
# or
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

- Verify the server starts without errors.
- Confirm the local URL, usually `http://localhost:3000`, is displayed.


## 2. Navigate Core Pages

Visit the following pages in your browser one by one. These pages demonstrate your site’s default structure:

- **Home/About Page**: Check it loads with a photo, introduction, and skills section.
- **Projects Page**: Confirm your projects are listed with links and descriptions.
- **Blog Page**: Verify the blog listing shows recent posts.
- **Contact Form**: Open the contact form modal from the envelope icon in the top navigation and check all fields display correctly.


## 3. Verify Blog Post Listing and Content

- Click on a blog post from the blog listing page.
- Confirm the post title, date, content body, and any images render accurately.
- Ensure links inside blog posts work as expected.


## 4. Check External Links and Redirects

Verify project repository and demo URLs open in new tabs and correctly redirect:

- Projects page contains GitHub repo links and external project URLs.
- Confirm that any redirected URLs (such as project aliases) take you to the correct destination.


## 5. Test Contact Form Submission Behavior

- Open the contact form modal via the envelope icon in the top right.
- Enter valid test data in the name, email, and message fields.
- Submit the form and verify no immediate client-side errors.
- Note: Since this uses Netlify form handling, check your deployment environment to confirm form receipt.


## 6. Validate Site Metadata and SEO Elements

- Inspect your browser tab title — it should show your site title.
- View page source and confirm meta tags like description, author, and SEO tags are present.


## 7. Confirm Site Responsiveness

- Resize the browser window or test on different devices to confirm the layout adapts correctly.
- Navigation and contact modal should work smoothly on mobile.

## Common Pitfalls and Checks

- ❌ **Blank pages or 404 errors:** Verify local server is running properly and content folders have posts or projects.
- ❌ **Broken external links:** Check project URLs and GitHub repositories are correctly configured.
- ❌ **Contact form not submitting:** Ensure you have enabled and configured Netlify forms on the deployed site.
- ❌ **Missing projects or posts:** Confirm content files exist in `src/content/blog` and your projects are properly listed in the frontend.

## Next Steps

After confirming this checklist:

- Proceed to [Configure Your Site](/getting-started/setup-installation/configuration-setup-basics) to customize metadata, branding, and build setup.
- Follow the [Launching Your Site Locally](/getting-started/first-run-validation/first-successful-run) guide for deeper validation and walkthrough.
- Review the [Troubleshooting Common Setup Issues](/getting-started/first-run-validation/common-setup-troubleshooting) if any step fails.


<Tip>
Maintaining a checklist early in your setup significantly reduces core issues during customization and deployment. Always validate basic functionality first.
