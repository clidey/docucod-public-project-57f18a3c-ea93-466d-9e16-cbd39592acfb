# Prerequisites & System Requirements

## Purpose & Positioning

Before you begin building or customizing your Astro-powered personal website, it's crucial to prepare your development environment properly. This section guides you through the essential tools, software, and system requirements needed to ensure a smooth installation and usage experience, regardless of whether you're on Windows, macOS, or Linux.

Understanding these prerequisites upfront helps you avoid common setup pitfalls and speeds up your workflow.

---

## System Requirements

- **Operating Systems Supported:**
  - Windows 10 or higher
  - macOS Catalina (10.15) or higher
  - Major Linux distributions (Ubuntu, Debian, Fedora, etc.)

- **Hardware:**
  - Minimum 4 GB RAM (8 GB or more recommended for faster builds)
  - At least 2 GHz dual-core processor
  - Minimum 2 GB free disk space for project and dependencies

- **Development Environment:**
  - Command line interface (Terminal on macOS/Linux, PowerShell or CMD on Windows)
  - Modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Edge, or Safari) for preview and testing

---

## Dependencies

To fully work with this project, you need several key software packages installed beforehand:

1. **Node.js & npm**

   Astro, the framework powering the site, runs on Node.js. npm (Node Package Manager) comes bundled with Node.js and is used for installing packages.

   - **Recommended Version:** Node.js 18.x or higher

   **Installation:**
   - Visit the official site: https://nodejs.org/
   - Download and install the LTS (Long Term Support) version appropriate for your OS

   **Verify installation:**
   ```bash
   node -v
   npm -v
   ```
   Expected output: version numbers displayed (e.g., v18.16.0 for node)

2. **Git**

   For cloning and managing the project code, Git version control is mandatory.

   - **Recommended Version:** Git 2.30 or higher

   **Installation:**
   - Windows: Download from https://git-scm.com/download/win (Git Bash included)
   - macOS: Install via Homebrew `brew install git` or download installer
   - Linux: Install via package manager (e.g., `sudo apt install git`)

   **Verify installation:**
   ```bash
   git --version
   ```
   Expected output: Git version number

3. **Code Editor (Recommended)**

   To edit and maintain site files efficiently, use a modern code editor:

   - Visual Studio Code: https://code.visualstudio.com/
   - JetBrains WebStorm (optional)

   These editors provide syntax highlighting, IntelliSense, and integrated terminal support.

## Access Requirements

- **GitHub Account (Optional but Recommended)**

  Having a GitHub account makes it easier to clone, fork, and contribute or deploy repositories.

- **Admin Rights on Your Machine**

  You may need administrator privileges to install software or configure environment variables.

- **Network & Firewall**

  Ensure your network allows HTTP/HTTPS access for downloading packages from npm and GitHub repositories.

  - Ports 80 (HTTP) and 443 (HTTPS) should be open.
  - Proxy configurations must allow these connections.

---

## Practical Tips & Best Practices

- Always use the **latest stable versions** of Node.js and Git to avoid compatibility issues.
- Prefer installing software from official sources to ensure security and integrity.
- When using Windows, consider using **Git Bash** or **Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL)** for a better terminal experience.
- Ensure your PATH environment variables include Node.js and Git executables for seamless CLI usage.

---

## Common Pitfalls & How to Avoid Them

- **Old Node.js Versions:** Using outdated Node.js versions causes build failures. Verify `node -v` before proceeding.
- **Missing Permissions:** Install software with appropriate privileges to avoid incomplete installations.
- **Network Restrictions:** Corporate networks may block HTTP/HTTPS requests; consult your network admin if npm installs fail.
- **Case Sensitivity Issues (Windows vs Linux):** Project files are case sensitive on macOS/Linux but not Windows. Be consistent with file naming.

## Verification Checklist

After installing prerequisites, confirm your setup:

```bash
node -v         # Should show v18.x or higher
npm -v          # Should show npm version
git --version   # Should show git version
```

Run a quick test to ensure npm can fetch packages:

```bash
npm init -y      # Creates a package.json file
npm install astro --save-dev   # Attempts to install Astro
```

If these commands complete without errors, your environment is ready for the next installation and configuration steps.
