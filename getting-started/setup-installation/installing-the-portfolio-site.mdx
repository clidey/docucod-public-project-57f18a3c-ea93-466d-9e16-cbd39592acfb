# Installing the Portfolio Site

This guide walks you through downloading or cloning the portfolio-site project and installing all necessary dependencies with your preferred package manager. You will learn how to set up a fully functional local environment so you can begin customizing and running the site immediately.

---

## 1. Prerequisites Check

Before installation, ensure your environment meets the following requirements:

- **Node.js**: Version 18.x or higher is required. Verify by running:

  ```bash
  node -v
  ```

  If not installed, download from [Node.js official website](https://nodejs.org/).

- **Git**: Required to clone the repository if you opt for this method. Check with:

  ```bash
  git --version
  ```

  Install Git from [Git official website](https://git-scm.com/) if missing.

- **Internet Connection**: Necessary to download dependencies from npm registries.

- **Package Manager**: You can use `npm`, `yarn`, or `pnpm`. Ensure your chosen manager is installed:

  ```bash
  npm -v
  yarn -v
  pnpm -v
  ```

  If not installed, pick one and follow its installation instructions.

## 2. Downloading the Project

Choose one of the following methods to obtain the project source code.

### Option A: Clone the GitHub Repository

1. Open your terminal or command prompt.
2. Navigate to your desired projects folder:

   ```bash
   cd ~/projects
   ```

3. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/modelorona/anguelh.com.git
   ```

4. Change into the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd anguelh.com
   ```

### Option B: Download ZIP from GitHub

1. Visit the repository page: [https://github.com/modelorona/anguelh.com](https://github.com/modelorona/anguelh.com)
2. Click the **Code** button.
3. Select **Download ZIP**.
4. Extract the ZIP file to a folder.
5. Open a terminal and navigate to that extracted folder.

## 3. Installing Dependencies

After obtaining the source code, install the project dependencies to prepare the environment.

### Using Your Preferred Package Manager

#### With npm

```bash
npm install
```

#### With Yarn

```bash
yarn install
```

#### With pnpm

```bash
pnpm install
```

> This command downloads all required packages listed in `package.json` and sets up the local environment.

---

## 4. Verifying Successful Installation

Confirm the packages installed correctly by checking the node_modules directory or running:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Or, if you are using yarn:

```bash
yarn dev
```

You should see an output indicating your Astro development server is running, such as:

```
[astro] Local: http://localhost:3000
[astro] Network: use --host to expose
[astro] Press Ctrl+C to stop
```

Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000` to verify the local site loads without errors.

## 5. Troubleshooting Common Installation Issues

<AccordionGroup title="Installation Troubleshooting">
<Accordion title="Node.js Version Issues">
Ensure your Node.js version meets the minimum requirement (>=18.x). Run:

```bash
node -v
```

If you see an older version, update Node.js using the official installers or tools like nvm.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Dependency Download Failures">
- Check your internet connection.
- If behind a proxy or firewall, configure your environment accordingly.
- Clear npm cache and retry:
  
  ```bash
  npm cache clean --force
  npm install
  ```
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Permission Errors on Installation">
- Avoid installing with sudo unless necessary.
- On Unix-like systems, fix permissions by resetting ownership of your project folder.
- Consider using a Node version manager to avoid global permission conflicts.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Missing Package Manager">
- Verify the package manager youâ€™re using is installed correctly.
- If commands like `npm` or `yarn` fail, reinstall them.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Port Conflicts on Dev Server Startup">
- If `npm run dev` fails because the port is in use, either stop the conflicting process or start the dev server on a different port:

  ```bash
  npm run dev -- --port 4000
  ```
</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## 6. Next Steps

Now that you have the portfolio site installed and dependencies configured:

- Proceed to **Configure Your Site** by adjusting `astro.config.mjs` as per your needs. See [Configuring Your Site](./configuration-setup-basics) for guidance.

- Launch your site locally using `npm run dev` and explore modifying pages, blog posts, and project listings.

- When ready, follow the [Deployment Guide](../../configuration/deployment/deployment-guide) to publish your website.
